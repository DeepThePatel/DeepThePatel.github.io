                <p> Many students and employees are upset about how each day the shuttle's time differs and is not constant which delays them. Variables that 
                    contribute to this problem include the drivers schedule, stopped trains, and conditions on the highways. To help combat this, we plan to create 
                    an application that tracks the location of shuttle’s and time as accurately as possible so our users know what time the shuttle is coming and they can use this information to decide if they should choose another source of transportation that day.

            <p>On the go students and workers who are either not close, not that close, or close to their determined destination.</p>

            <h3>What is the problem?</h3>

        <section>
            <h3>Where does the problem present itself?</h3>
            <p>Presents itself in the morning of weekdays for people going to school and work</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
            <p>This matters as it is affecting students from being able to get good grades and causing some people to get looked down on for “not being on time” 
           when it is not their fault. It also causes employees and students to drive, get a ride , or pay for a ride which all of these options cause the person to either waste money or gas.</p>
